# Metalli-More
"Master of Lyrics I'm Transforming Your Tokens
Learning your patterns and sampling out new verses
Reading from me, you can't tell a difference
Just give me a title, I'll make you new lyrics"

Inspired by Makemore by Andrej Karpathy. But instead of generating the works of Shakespeare, we generate Metallica lyrics.
